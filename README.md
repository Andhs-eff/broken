# Broken Translator

This project is a simple web application that translates text through a series of different languages and then back to the original language. This often results in a "broken" or humorous translation.

## Running the Project

To run this project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Project Structure

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.
*   `index.js`: Contains the JavaScript code for handling user input, making API calls to Google Translate, and displaying the translated text.
*   `CI_Background.png`: A background image used for styling the page.
*   `favicon.ico`: The icon for the website.

## Dependencies

*   This project uses the Google Translate API (unofficially) to perform translations. Availability and functionality may vary.
